               d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton.
(Note-While realizing the group, duplicate entries are avoided, and no SET built-in functions are used)

DSL_Assign_9: Write a Python program to compute following computation on matrix:
              a) Addition of two matrices.
              b) Subtraction of two matrices.
              c) Multiplication of two matrices.
              d) Transpose of a matrix.

DSL_Assign_11: a)	Write a Python program to store roll numbers of student in array who attended training program in random order. Write function for searching whether particular                   student attended training program or not, using Linear search and Sentinel search.
               b)	Write a Python program to store roll numbers of student array who attended training
                  program in sorted order. Write function for searching whether particular student attended training program or not, using Binary search and Fibonacci search

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DSL_Assign_14: Write a Python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function for sorting array of floating-point numbers in ascending order using:
	             a) Selection Sort.
	             b) Bubble Sort and display top 5 scores.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DSL_Assign_16: Write a Python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function for sorting array of floating-point numbers in ascending order using                  Quick Sort and display top five scores.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DSL_Assign_19: Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'pinnacle club’.  Students of second, third and final year of department can be granted membership on                request. Similarly, on may cancel the membership of club. First node is reserved for the president of the club and last node is reserved for the secretary of                    club. write C++ program to maintain club members information using singly linked list. Store student PRN and Name. Write function to:
                  a) Add and Delete the members as well as the president or even secretary.
                  b) Compute total numbers of members of club.
                  c) Display members.
                  d) Display list in reverse order using recursion.
                  e) Two linked lists exists for two divisions. Concatenate two lists.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DSL_Assign_22: Second year Computer Engineering class, Set A of students like Vanilla Ice-cream and set B of students like Butterscotch ice-cream. Write C++ program to store two                sets using Linked List. Compute and Display:
                i) Set of students who like both vanilla and butterscotch.
                ii) Set of students who like either vanilla or butterscotch or not both.
	              iii) Number of students who like neither vanilla nor butterscotch.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DSL_Assign_26: In any language program mostly syntax error occurs due to unbalancing delimiter such as (), {}, []. Write C++ program using stack to check whether given                          expression is well parenthesized or not.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DSL_Assign_27: Implement C++ program for expression conversion as infix to postfix and its evaluation using stack based on given conditions:
	              1. Operands and operators, both must be single character.
	              2. Input Postfix expression must be in a desired format.
	              3. Only ‘+’, ‘- ‘, ‘*’ and ‘/’ operators are expected.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DSL_Assign_29: Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the creation of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not                use priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. Write C++ program for simulating job queue. Write functions to add job and delete                job from queue.
